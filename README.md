# Citen
Decentralized (P2P) and secure document sharing platform designed for citizen journalists, and written in Rust.

### Quick Disclaimer
This project is intended to be a proof-of-concept. While it should work, there are no guarantees as to how well nor a bug-free experience. The primary purpose of this project is to be an aid in helping to teach myself about TCP, Rust, and decentralized systems. There are a million ways this project could be improved (if you notice any, please open a PR).

### Project Status
Still under primary development. This will be updated once the main protocol has been implemented.

## Contributing
Please open a PR or issue if you have any changes, suggestions, or bug reports. I'll do my best to review them as they come in.
